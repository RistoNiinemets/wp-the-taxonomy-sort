Allows you to easily change the order of different taxonomies/terms/categories.

## Description

Most commonly taxonomy sorting plugins will create a new interface to drag or order/sort your terms. This plugin uses the built-in view just to make things easier. Just grab the term and drag it to a new position. No more extra clicks - everything is saved after repositioning!

## Installation

1. Upload `the-taxonomy-sort/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to taxonomy page (for example Posts -> Categories) and drag the table rows to change ordering.
